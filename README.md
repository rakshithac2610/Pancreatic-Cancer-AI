# 🧠 Prediction and Detection of Pancreatic Cancer using Explainable Multimodal AI

## 📌 Overview
This project is an AI-based clinical decision support system for pancreatic cancer detection using CT scans, laboratory data, and radiology reports.

## 🚀 Features
- CT scan tumor detection and segmentation (nnUNet)
- Tumor volume and size calculation
- Stage prediction using lab values
- Survival estimation
- Explainable AI outputs (Heat Maps, text highlights)

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python, Flask
- PyTorch, nnUNet
- OpenCV, Pydicom
- NLP (Gemini API)
